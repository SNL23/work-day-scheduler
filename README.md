# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This webpage was created for anyone with a busy schedule so that they can manage thier time more effectively. This project was build so that the user can create a schedule and add important events to the planner. In this project I was able to add the current day to the top of the planner. I also added a click function, so that when the saved button was clicked it saved users input in the local storage. Lastly, I was able to color code the time blocks to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. While working on this project, I learned how Dayjs works to input dates and time onto a webpage and how to format it. I also learned how the code for local storage is implamented and how to retrieve the saved data. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a daily planner that can save the users task when inputed into a time block. The color code helps the user know what time it is and what event they have or have had planned in the day.
